               <h2>A little story about how we came to be…</h2>

               <p>Noushine, Justine, and Shelby came up with the idea of the <strong>“after-party brunch”</strong> during their time as master’s students in London. After a fun night of clubbing, they realized all they ever wanted was food (and right away). By the time the night was over, every restaurant and kebab place was closed, and breakfast wasn’t for a few hours. <i>“Why hasn’t anyone ever thought of a place to party all night <strong>AND</strong> brunch all morning?”</i> Justine thought out loud. Noushine and Shelby looked over with glazed eyes and huge smiles. Thus it began.</p>
